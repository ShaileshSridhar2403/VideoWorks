00:00:00 welcome to the seventh letter in this and Patel course on food Mechanics for chemical engineering undergraduate students in the last lecture we discussed the fundamental equation of fluid Statics we were discussing fluids 
00:00:30 under static conditions and we derive a fundamental equation four fluids that is a depressant and under the influence of a gravitational field so we started by taking a volume element volume element of fluid under the influence of gravity and in the limit van so we took a coordinate system x y and set volume element 
00:01:00 Diamond chains with the volume element shrinks we drive a fundamental equation Fort Road Statics is equal to 0 minus the gradient of pressure + density of the fluid X gravity is equal to zero this is a fundamental equation that is of used in describing 7 features of fruits that explodes out of the starting conditions it is customary to point 
00:01:30 the gravity right along the negatives that direction as shown here so that a three-unit rectus eye J & K in Holland X y&z Direction so the acceleration due to gravity Vector is given by minus g x K-Rock AC unit repair in the posters that direction but Jesus pointing the negative Direction so - - G happens because of. 
00:02:00 so when we substitute this when we refer to this equation to this coordinate system before this particular Corner system this equation is very gentle because it has no reference to unicorn exist this is genital okay when I apply to the coordinate system shown here 
00:02:30 we get - parcel P parcel X no defective G can we return as g x x i + g y x j x k Station directions and Industry coordinate system g x 0 & Y 0 and Jesus is mine a c k so we can proceed further 
00:03:00 by saying the DP - dpdx zero because the exit zero and minus dpd why is it all because g y 0 + - dpd set is 0 and that said that action this implies that P is independent off X and Y I need where is One Direction and this applies since piercing 
00:03:30 the Apostle everything becomes a normal delivery 2K - DVDs are astrology or dpd service we can integrate this okay if row is a constant Angie is normally a constant undertale skin conditions 
00:04:00 on the surface of it is a constant then dpd set it's minus Raja can be integrated as follows between any two points Mayan astrology decent since Roe and since Roland gr concerts we can pull them out so integral DP between any two points peanut and pee is my 
00:04:30 SOG Integra not to any set desert so be mine Aspen. It's nothing but minus r o g x Zed - said not or B- P not astrology times and not when I said after absorbing the minus side okay now this can also be at at 10 
00:05:00 aspie at any said - peanut is r o g x are not mine I said okay so you know how does that coordinate going up like this suppose you have a fluid suppose you have a water body which is exposed to Atmosphere at weather 
00:05:30 pressure is p atmosphere the pressure of pressure of air in the atmosphere is due to the weight of the Earth at this present about about a given elevation so at sea level the pressure of a liquid atmosphere pressure that is precisely because of the weight of the air that is present about 11 so this is known so if you call this location as equals that not take me to the free surface where he is 
00:06:00 iSpy atmosphere then be at any location said is not witches. Most rare plus Rosie I'm sad North - Ed said is any location Android Note is this location is this debt from the free surface so this is conventionally denoted by the letter H Sophie at any location 
00:06:30 in the liquid SP at mosphere plus Roadie Edge this is something that you may be familiar with from your earlier classes in physics why the pressure in a column of liquid increases with vertical distance in a linear manner and that's precisely because of the fact that the pressure supposed to take a column of liquid and this is atmospheric pressure so pressure on my socks normally toes 
00:07:00 if you look at the pressure on this side this pressure will have to be greater than atmospheric pressure because of the fact that under certain conditions the fluid will have to balance the weight of this liquid column which is precisely given by r o g h x the area of the element of this equation and this is valid only for incompressible fluids Heroes concert 
00:07:30 where was the concert let me just spend a couple of minutes commenting on the nature of atmospheric pressure be at mosphere the upholstery pressure is precisely the pressure off the air fattest president 
00:08:00 okay and so is you come to the sea level that is ground level then if you take a cylinder can call him the weight of this app is precisely the pressure that you can feed at the ground level and your vacuum what does Mendes no app when you go far away from the ground level K far into the atmosphere that is the density of iron decrease significantly 
00:08:30 the pressure ulcer decrease the pressure of Adizero okay so there's no add money cuz there's no pressure and the pressure at the ground level is called atmospheric pressure and high pressure is roughly 10 to the 5 baskets what's 10 to the 5 Newton per meter squared in SI units the other thing we discussed was the role of compressibility so if Ida Street at compressor 
00:09:00 go to be an ideal gas so we said that b is row the specific gas constants time tea then you had - DVD set is a DP desert is -0 G set inside of Rome so this implacable is speed by rgt 
00:09:30 so I can eliminate DP weddings that is minus x g acceleration due to gravity so I can integrate this in the Falling Rain DP by P integral - G by rgt Integrity so long as you love me is nothing but mine 
00:10:00 zyr GT plus some constant right as p s peanut X exponential of - g y r g t and t is assumed to be constant in this analysis the art of the constant temperature is called the constant e not times 
00:10:30 what is the value pressure at the equals zero condition boundary condition to use to fix this concert Wisconsin districts by saying that the pressure is equal to 0 Oz peanut Sophie is Peanut X exponential off -3 by 18. This is an equation that is valid if I dusted Compass will but we also say 
00:11:00 if the value of the exponent by rgt not is small compared to one group so if this number is small compared to one you can tell it expand Android vs Vino * 1 - 1 - x is approximately 1 - x if x is small 
00:11:30 so 1 - Jeezy by rgt not so PSP not - peanut butter allergy did not Desert from ideal gas. This is nothing but your not so please. - It or Not Jesus. So this is similar to the incompressible expression. 3/8 reading density to be constant so this 
00:12:00 linear relation is a simplification of this exponential relation of pressure and it's valid if G by rgt not is STEEZ advance notice less than 0.1 or if that is less than 800 meter we can't read the pressure variation Even in our Richardson Channel accomplishable system to be a mini-vacation so 
00:12:30 the other thing the next thing we'll do is to apply the fundamental equation of hydrostatics to what is called manometry manometry is that branch of fluid mechanics which deals with measurement of pressures 
00:13:00 and the specific device we are going to use is called a YouTube manometer so what is the construction well it consists of a U-shaped you and 1 and is exposed to atmosphere 
00:13:30 the other end is joined to a region whose pressure we want to know so hear the let's call this point as a K2 pressure here is not known special unknown the monument was filled with working liquid call Amanda Matic liquid now this is over 
00:14:00 atmosphere latest pressure unknown pressure to the atmospheric pressure which is now so how do we go about doing this let us know draw some label some Heights here that is called this height Middle School Des height as H3 let's call this site sh4 
00:14:30 let us call this hide sh2 and between point a and this interfaces H1 okay so we want to know apply the principle of the result from fundamental equation of hydrostatics Steffi SPF most feared 
00:15:00 now if you go from point share to share the pressure will increase this is atmospheric pressure the pressure will increase because of the weight of iPad but that is negligible so we're not worried about this from this point now we're going to between these two points between these two levels the pressure at this point in the pressure at this point is the same cause the pressure in this man o matic liquid is a function only of the elevation 
00:15:30 and elevations of the single pressure at this point which is called let's call it be and the pressure at this point D must be the same Sophie B must be equal to PD because pressure in the measurement of liquid as a function One Lie of the elevation and since these two points out of the same elevation Phoebe must be equal to. If so how do we get TV in terms of Paul TV is nothing but PA 
00:16:00 plus Rogue one let us call this liquid Rogue one with the density Rogue one acceleration due to gravity X this column height H1 Rowan gh1 this is the pressure at point B now PD the pressure at this point D is given by the pressure at this point which is approximately atmospheric pressure romantic Liquidators College Road 
00:16:30 so that's if this liquid to Miami today for DeSoto mg the store height is H for this is H4 and so this guy does H for this is H2 so then this the weight of the height of this column is age for minors okay so we can write me a minus P atmosphere the difference in the value of the pressure at the point 
00:17:00 minus atmospheric pressure is nothing but row M GH4 - H2 -1 g h one okay so by measuring these two heights by measuring the height difference is 4 - 2/8 4-6 to basically decide by measuring this height that is this an typically the density 
00:17:30 automatic liquid is very large compared to the density of the working fluid so this is usually negligible usually invisible so we can get the difference in the value of pressure at Point a from the atmospheric pressure to be the density of the monomer liquid * acceleration due to gravity times the height difference between the two limbs of the manometer 
00:18:00 a fundamental equation of manometry and by just simply measuring the height we measure this to obtain the unknown pressure now this difference is called the gauge pressure as I mentioned in the last picture the difference between the value of a pressure at a point from the atmospheric pressure is called the gauge pressure and because that is what is measured by pressure measuring devices such as 
00:18:30 deep Mananitas know how do how does one measure atmospheric pressure in order to do that we have what is called a barometer usually the monomer liquid is mercury is typically 13.6 x 10 to the 3 Kg for somebody not density liquid 
00:19:00 a barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure so this is the device that is used to obtain what Testament are positive pressure how is it done well the construction of the battle is very simple you take of Mercury 
00:19:30 and then in this stuff we in what are two which already has mercury in it when does rise to win the civil rights to a particular height this is at at 1:30 pressure be at most fear in this part it is largely vacuum weed has some Vape 
00:20:00 molecules of a mercury vapor sensor vapor pressure of mercury is very very small this is essentially vacuum if there's no pressure here so the pressure pressure from from the fact that this liquid is exposed to add now the pressure at this point must be the same as the pressure at this point because this is connected by the same liquid the same liquid is connecting these two points and since they are the same 
00:20:30 Mission there going to be any pressure difference okay so the pressure at this point is also atmospheric so the pressure at this point which is atmospheric pressure is the pressure at Point a witches let's call it be able to see it all because it said vacuum + row Mercury g x h where H is the height of the column of Mercury that is present in The Chew 
00:21:00 so which is what we want to calculate it won this can be obtained by measuring what is the height of mercury okay so typically this height is 760 mm at normal conditions of temperature and altitudes so that Mosaic pressure it's nothing but 
00:21:30 the density of mercury this is 13.6 x 10 to the 3 x 9.8 meters per second squared x 4.76 meters this is height when we do all this week at atmospheric pressure to me 1.03 * 2 
00:22:00 the five Newton per meter squared 1.3 x 10 to the 5 baskets so the barometer is used to calculate atmospheric pressure in several text books or even handbooks is denoted in terms of SI units as 1.13 x 10 to the 5 Pascal's 6 p.m. 
00:22:30 H-E-B close at is the height of the Mercury column the prices to counterbalance atmospheric pressure so it does sometimes referred in terms of mmhg this altar Trivoli on call this one because it is a normal pressure that is encoded in on pulse rate is a door open to the high pastures so sweet 1.13 x 10 to the 5 Pascal's social sciences off 
00:23:00 so Michael Cole so all these are used interchangeably while reporting the values of pressure know that you have done all this now we're going to worry about the next topic richest horses Honda Static forces on solid surface I was supposed on Subs 
00:23:30 suffices under static conditions so the issue that we are going to understand is the following suppose you have a liquid surface that it is exposed to Atmosphere atmosphere that is a 
00:24:00 suffice a planar surface look at planar surface for Simplot simplicity so you have a plane and this plane externs in the third direction to let me put coordinate system my sister said coordinate this is t y coordinate and the x coordinate runs in the direction perpendicular to the boat so 
00:24:30 if you look at the XY plane look at the xy-plane the surface may look like this guy so now since I'm in the wiser pandas look like a line if it goes discipline a surface just like a plate with some Arabic belly shape do you want to know and this is let's a liquid like water 
00:25:00 we want to know and gravity is acting in this direction and this is the liquid surface where the pressure is atmospheric we want to know what is the force that is exerted by the fluid on one side of the solar surface on this plane or Surface so the question that you're asking the question that you want to answer is what is the four 
00:25:30 FR that is exerted by the food now we also want to know the point at which the the point explain why Prime eye twitch 
00:26:00 resultant Force xc1 to calculate these two things okay now why is this thing important well this thing is important in several applications with suppose you are interested in construction of a dam so a dime is something that stores or up sex water okay this is water and this office has 
00:26:30 concert in such a manner that withstands the force due to the water and the reason why hydrostatics is different is because the pressure varies with the depth so the pressure at this point is but as you go down the pressure will increase linearly so the force will not be at the force cannot be obtained by simply multiplying the pressure by the area it has to be obtained by Integrity in the pressure with respect to the y coordinate so this is what we want to do so in order 
00:27:00 the baby going to proceed is my taking a tiny strip in the you take a tiny area element of length d x d y so basically what I need and this tiny element is a distance vertical distance h k 
00:27:30 I'm on this area element the pressure force will be acting purely normally because of Florida's starting so the definition force acting on this area element is purely normal and what is differential forces the pressure at the vertical location H from the free Surface Times the area d x d y this is the essential idea of doing the whole thing okay so today s t y s d a 
00:28:00 this is all we will do nautical Z2 force is nothing but you take the differential for Speedy acting on a tiny Slice on Integra to order and let me give you that a certain Force no pee is nothing but we not + 38 so far is nothing but integral 
00:28:30 be not + r o d h x d a now it so this is why this is why this is H this is Tita so H is basically let me see this descendants it's like you differently 
00:29:00 this Angela Statham so this is the surface this Angeles theater this is H this is why okay I just nothing wet why sign Peter so do you want the value at 1H so instead of it will do why the coordinators along the surface that is why 
00:29:30 so Vince AFR is nothing but integral a 0 + r o g y this isn't one calculates the force resultant force on a surface that is submerged in a fluid the way this force is done calculator it is you could you define the central 
00:30:00 damn of a plane centroid of a plane the plane which is on XY plane is 108 area integral area the ex-wife and this is the centroid of the coordinates of the centroid of a surface so integral yda is nothing worth 
00:30:30 I see time skate okay so we have from here if it's 3:08 appointment aggression PCOS a constant it's usually a g sign theater since y d a Integra LS YZ so you like this s y c a r p 0 + r o g this is sometimes referred to as HC 
00:31:00 CA is this the pressure at the centroid of the area of the surface so fr the resultant Force is the pressure that the centroid X the area for the forces that are being exerted on a planar surface 
00:31:30 that is submerged into inside liquid like water and a static conditions 2 comments firstly this Force actually on one side so we're looking at recalled at the geometry is like this this is Tita this is the free surface this is liquid okay this is the first one we acting on one side. The same amount of force will act 
00:32:00 disabled so what if the other side is open to some of this some of that it may be open. This is the force that is because of the liquid that is present on one side of the surface so it depends on the problem and contacts as to what the other side is if it is opened atmosphere than this will be the first to the liquid that is present and the pressure variation in the liquid under static conditions what is the point of action of the force 
00:32:30 what is the point of action well in order to find the point of action we simply take the moment so let's call the point of action is why Prime so why Prime the moment of the force about the point of action must be equal to the distributed moment y x p x DEA or enter so why it's nothing but why is Rosie signed it. 
00:33:00 if on one side you have liquid another side you have atmospheric at then you need not worry about the atmospheric pressure Sophia simply returned as the gauge pressure because the contribution to the atmospheric pressure on the side and the side with cancer so we can pressure android-volley the gauge pressure so this is Rosie it's e x a 
00:33:30 Sofia Sony PSP g r o g x h r o g y sign theater y Square PA what are far is nothing but PC times the pressure of the central times prodigy 
00:34:00 KSTP. X integral y Squad y squared x r o g y c Saint Peter integral a twice quietly so BCS nothing retro GY6 90. If the other side is surrounded by 
00:34:30 so this implies y Prime is nothing but one by a y c k integral so there's this a here that's coming the denominator integral y sqrt x d this is the line of action of the force lettuce I'm going to act on a submerged Plano surface Okay so this is a fuel sensor 
00:35:00 applications where you are interested in the forces that being accepted by the fluid on the starting conditions on Solid Surfaces and this is a family of interest in storage of water in dams and so I will not go through this for want of time so I'll go to the next topic which is buoyancy 
00:35:30 which is also later two forces exerted on coats surfaces suppose you have an object that is a solid object it is completely immersed in a liquid so you have resurface that is at most fear you have a liquid like water so you have a solid object is completely must now 
00:36:00 how to say you're putting a corn inside like this and gravity is acting like this Mount this density has this liquid as density row not because of the fact that does this liquid has a density and acceleration due to gravity is acting downwards the pressure here is peer pressure here is more so the pressure exerted on this site on this sub submerged Solid Surfaces more than the pressure that way exerted on the side 
00:36:30 does the pressure is less buoyancy Force so how do we estimate of the expression for the buoyancy Force it's not very difficult you simply have to take a thin cylindrical volume element is called this height shop 
00:37:00 it's basically Queen. The pressure of the top less this is Peanut Live say smooth this is the phone number to the equation of hydrostatics so the net vertical Force force on this volume cylinder cone volume is nothing but fear not + rosi let's call this H2 
00:37:30 I just called the top surface is cheapest H1 H2 times day -3 note plus r o g h 1 * 58 so as to message 1 let's call it 8 sociology HDA this is SDA is the differential volume of the 
00:38:00 cylinder volume element so the net vertical Force on this infinitesimal volume element is x t differential volume so the network equal force on a cylindrical volume element that is present in a solid that is submerged in a fluid the differential Force quality of service Project X 
00:38:30 this what we just did I get a differential volume of this volume element and this force is precisely because of the fact that the pressure here and the pressure here are different and because of the fact that the flutist Underground Station feeling the pressure varies due to hydrostatic equation is balanced object is differential Force 
00:39:00 Center object which is nothing but integrating over the entire volume gdv Saints Row g a constant K so you get roji integral off the TV which is nothing but a g x the volume of tea object but let's try to understand just slightly differently this is r o x v x g Heroes density of the liquid in which this object is present 
00:39:30 DeVos off the Liquidators displaced by the solid so the net vertical force on a solid substance solid object that is completely submerged in a liquid which is present under gravitational field 
00:40:00 this is called the buoyancy force and this is nothing but the weight of the fluid that is displaced Bybee solid object this is of course the famous Archimedes principle so this is called a 
00:40:30 Archimedes principle this is again a consequence of the basic equation Force balancing hydrostatics and we merely have to a playlist to the context of object that is immersed so this is for a fully what we drive is full of food is for a fully submerged object suppose you have a floating object 
00:41:00 okay supposed to have an object that is partially submerged which is floating so you have SS upholstery air pressure this is liquid K suppose you have a partially submerged object object so when did this part is how much so this portion has displaced submerged 
00:41:30 has displaced the volume of fluid force will be because of the fact that all due to the weight of the displaced fluid okay so this is gravity now this solid object this and a stable equilibrium that does it's not syncing it's not going down that means that the net downward force on the solid object this is is mass of the solid object X acceleration due to gravity 
00:42:00 SP equal to the buoyancy Force which is acting up work this is the downward Force the support Force because the buoyancy does the density of the liquid intoxication due to gravity timestep displaced volume cuz one of the displaced volume will contribute to the net upward Force so this is the condition for floating okay that the net download Force must be equal to the net upward Force which is 
00:42:30 24 switches nothing but row times the density of the Liquid X acceleration due to gravity attempts a displaced one ice ice bugs are found in oceans K & C in Ocean okay so this is the water level and this whole 
00:43:00 submerged underwater this whole thing is submerged underwater so let's call this submerged volume be underwater vuw did the mass of the iceberg BM is Iceberg mass and the total volume of iceberg is we total total volume of iceberg density of ice is smaller than 
00:43:30 Isis smarter than density of water density of water is 1 grams per CC and those devices point 9 programs for cc centimeter Cube okay so if this iceberg is under stable equilibrium then the mass of the iceberg times the acceleration due to gravity is the weight of the iceberg is nothing but the buoyancy Force this is the weight of the displaced fluid which is nothing but the volume that is submerged underwater of the iceberg X dance 
00:44:00 oxidation due to gravity what is the total mass of the iceberg lettuce nothing but raw rice times the total volume x g s v underwater times roll liquid which is let's a water Here chords x g g cancels so V underwater by we total just a fraction of volume that is underwater is nothing but throw ice 
00:44:30 Rural Water this is nothing we're Point 92 / 16.9 to okay so what is simple example is telling you is that in a floating iceberg 100% of the solid Moses Underwood solid masses under water 
00:45:00 it's a stapled consequence of the buoyancy principle that 90% of the ice in an ice box is completely under water okay we can also drive a simple criteria for floating when does an object float when can objects float let's consider a simple geometry here 
00:45:30 can is considered a very simple geometry to get this result okay it's just Tech a cylindrical object and this is what are elected assembly object is 14 floating this is water this is okay so floating happens when the wait. What force acting you translation 
00:46:00 gravity on the solid object is equal to the buoyant force which is nothing but so let's call this height at the submerged S8 so the volume of cylinder that is submerged is 8 times 8 times the density of the fluid is Roy f x g is nothing but supposed to let's call this whole hi does l a l x Rose wallet x g is nothing with a x x x t 
00:46:30 okay so if you cancel a and g k so floating we can happen by definition floating means floating means less than otherwise completely immersed in the water is less than less than l then this equation tells you that Rogue SL is row FH this implies that row SS 
00:47:00 Royal this is a necessary condition for floating this is an excellent condition for floating so this completes the basic concepts that are that can be obtained by simple concentrations of a fluid and a static conditions so just to recap 
00:47:30 he first arrived the governing equation for fluids and the static conditions which was simply - Dead 3 + r o g is zero and using this in this late show me derive the fundamental equation for a man of me just the principle of manometry and then we introduced the notion of atmospheric pressure and barometers did I have the forces that experienced by a planet's surface that is submerged inside out 
00:48:00 and my phone. It can be very easily obtained by integrating the pressure on a small area element and buying tickets for the entire area we can get the force and we can also find the line of action of the resultant force on a solid surface next week to discuss the notion of buoyancy on a completely submerged solid surface and we can derive the Archimedes principles from the basic equation of hydrostatics 
00:48:30 the net force don't download on a Monday on on the solid surface is greater than the net force on the upper surface of the solid so this results to the buoyancy and Archimedes principle from the basic equation of Roots Alex and we also saw when can an object float and what are the necessary conditions under which an object floats so this discussion on fluid Statics which is one of the simplest Topics in fluid mechanics because the subject of 
00:49:00 mechanics deals with fluid flow but Spruce Statics is an integral part because even at the starting conditions the forces that are being inserted are not simple because of the fact that the pressure in a fluid where is with vertical distance in the next later so we'll see in the next election
